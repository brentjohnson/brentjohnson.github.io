## The Journey

### Introduction

> Everyone needs to eat.
>
>Whatever your reason for coming to Gloomhaven, out here on the edge of the world, that simple fact is never going to change. A mercenary can’t fight on an empty stomach.
>
>So when Jekserah, a Valrath woman wearing a red cloak and enough gold jewelry to keep you fed for a decade, approaches you in the Sleeping Lion and offers to pay you ten gold coins to track down a thief and retrieve some stolen goods...well, it seems like as good an excuse as any to sober up and start paying off your tab.
>
>“This thief has taken some important documents,” says the red-skinned merchant, her tail whipping about in agitation. “I don’t care what you do to him. Just bring back what is mine.”
>
>Based on Jekserah’s description, it was easy enough to knock around a few alley thugs and get a location of the thieves’ hideout. You don’t find yourself as a mercenary way out in Gloomhaven without knowing
how to crack a few skulls.
>
>So your target is the Black Barrow. Sounds like a lovely place.

### The Black Barrow (#1)

Conclusion

>With the last bandit dead, you take a moment to catch your breath and steel yourself against the visions of living remains ripping at your flesh. Your target is not among the dead, and you shudder to think what horrors still await you in the catacombs below.

### Barrow Lair (#2)

Conclusion

>Sifting through the carnage left by the battle, you find a cache at the back of the room containing the scrolls you were hired to collect. You can’t help but rifle through them a bit, but find that the writing upon them is in some unknown archaic language. One thing that does jump out at you, however, is a map of the northern countryside. A bend in the Still River is clearly marked as a point of interest. Contemplating whether you want to find out more about this so-called “Gloom,” you decide that the spot could be a point of interest for you, as well. 4
>
>But that can be forgotten for the moment. You pack up the papers and head back to Gloomhaven to collect your reward.
>
>Meeting Jekserah once again at the Sleeping Lion, you hand over the papers and are paid the agreed-upon amount.
>
>“You know,” she whispers to you softly under
the bustle of the tavern. “If you’re interested, I may have another job for you. A tribe of Inox in the Dagger Forest has ransacked a couple of my caravans headed to the Capital.
>
>“I told the militia, but they do nothing,” she spits. “I can point you in the direction of their encampment. If you can make an example of them, I will pay you even more.”
>
>She places a crude map of the forest on the table and stands up, her jewelry clinking with the movement. “Come find me when it is done.” 3

### Inox Encampment

Conclusion

>Running through the forest, fleeing the smell of burning flesh, you now find more than enough opportunity to contemplate your actions.
>
>How your actions sit with you must be visible on your face as you meet once more with Jekserah, this time in her manor. She hands you a sack of coins with a frown.
>
>“They were thieves and murderers,” she says blankly. “They deserved what you gave them.
>
>And that is all I will say of the matter. I have one more task I would like you to perform. I require a diamond of considerable size for a customer, but I cannot find one anywhere in the city.
>
>“There is a diamond mine, however, in the southern mountains long since lost to the wilderness. I’ve heard reports that it is now overrun with Vermlings, no doubt with some other more intelligent force behind them. If you can fight your way in and grab the biggest diamond you can find, I will give you a considerable reward. 9
>
>“Now leave me in peace.” Jekserah’s two massive Inox bodyguards step forward, directing you to leave the manor.
>
>Outside, contemplating your new task, you hear a small voice behind you. “She’s not looking for profit, you know.”
>
>You turn around to see a female Quatryl step out of the alley beside Jekserah’s house. She’s clad in dark leather armor and holds a conspicuous contraption full of whirring gears and topped with a conical metal piece connected to a tube.
>
>“Argeise, city guard,” she says, introducing herself. “I know, I don’t exactly look the part, but if anyone isn’t what they appear to be, it’s that Valrath you’ve been talking to. Sure, she’s a merchant, but she’s up to something far more sinister.
>
>“She’s been trying to overthrow the military in Gloomhaven for as long as I’ve been here, and we’re all very curious about what her current machinations are.
>
>“Look, you can go do her bidding like a good little puppy if you want, but if you’d rather actually help this town keep the peace and not get overrun by the wilds, I have a different idea. We’ll get to the bottom of Jekserah’s plans and expose her for who she really is.” 8

So now it is decision time.  We chicken out and go back to investigate the "Gloom"

### Crypt of the Damned (#4)

>It is clear that you have disrupted some sort of ritual here. These elemental demons belong on an entirely different plane of existence, but the cultists have somehow managed to pull them through to this one.
>
>On the altar in the back room, there is a wealth of scribblings on these rituals. Not all the writing is intelligible, but you get the sense that this crypt is a place of power once used by an ancient civilization. The ancients tapped the power of the elements to enhance their own lives, and while their exact fate is beyond your knowledge, it clearly didn’t end well.
>
>Among the scripts you also find notes on a couple of other places of power in the area. One appears to see heavy use with the cult and the other is marked as being overrun by vicious undead. It looks as though you have opportunities to either disrupt more of their work 5 or get in their good graces by helping to clear out a threat. 6
